=====

`cheat` allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the
command-line. It was designed to help remind \*nix system administrators of
options for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to
remember.

Example
-------
The next time you're forced to disarm a nuclear weapon without consulting
Google, you may run:

```sh
cheat tar
```

You will be presented with a cheatsheet resembling the following:

```sh
# To extract an uncompressed archive:
tar -xvf '/path/to/foo.tar'

# To extract a .gz archive:
tar -xzvf '/path/to/foo.tgz'

# To create a .gz archive:
tar -czvf '/path/to/foo.tgz' '/path/to/foo/'

# To extract a .bz2 archive:
tar -xjvf '/path/to/foo.tgz'

# To create a .bz2 archive:
tar -cjvf '/path/to/foo.tgz' '/path/to/foo/'
```

Usage
-----
To view a cheatsheet:

```sh
cheat tar      # a "top-level" cheatsheet
cheat foo/bar  # a "nested" cheatsheet
```

To edit a cheatsheet:

```sh
cheat -e tar     # opens the "tar" cheatsheet for editing, or creates it if it does not exist
cheat -e foo/bar # nested cheatsheets are accessed like this
```

To view the configured cheatpaths:

```sh
cheat -d
```

To list all available cheatsheets:

```sh
cheat -l
```

To list all cheatsheets that are tagged with "networking":

```sh
cheat -l -t networking
```

To list all cheatsheets on the "personal" path:

```sh
cheat -l -p personal
```

To search for the phrase "ssh" among cheatsheets:

```sh
cheat -s ssh
```

To search (by regex) for cheatsheets that contain an IP address:

```sh
cheat -r -s '(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
```

Cheatsheets
-----------
Cheatsheets are plain-text files with optional file extensions. When the extension is excluded, they are named
according to the command used to view them:

```sh
cheat tar     # file is named "tar" or "tar.EXTENSION"
cheat foo/bar # file is named "bar" or "bar.EXTENSION", in a "foo" subdirectory
```

Cheatpaths
----------
Cheatsheets are stored on "cheatpaths", which are directories that contain
cheatsheets. Cheatpaths are specified in the `conf.yml` file.

It can be useful to configure `cheat` against multiple cheatpaths. A common
pattern is to store cheatsheets from multiple repositories on individual
cheatpaths:

```yaml
# conf.yml:
# ...
cheatpaths:
  - name: community                   # a name for the cheatpath
    path: ~/documents/cheat/community # the path's location on the filesystem
    tags: [ community ]               # these tags will be applied to all sheets on the path
    readonly: true                    # if true, `cheat` will not create new cheatsheets here

  - name: personal
    path: ~/documents/cheat/personal  # this is a separate directory and repository than above
    tags: [ personal ]
    readonly: false                   # new sheets may be written here
# ...
```

The `readonly` option instructs `cheat` not to edit (or create) any cheatsheets
on the path. This is useful to prevent merge-conflicts from arising on upstream
cheatsheet repositories.

If a user attempts to edit a cheatsheet on a read-only cheatpath, `cheat` will
transparently copy that sheet to the first writeable directory in 'cheatpaths' before opening it for
editing.
